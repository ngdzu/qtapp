# Lesson 21: Animation and Transitions

This lesson demonstrates Qt's animation framework with QPropertyAnimation and animation groups.

## Building and Running

### One-Time Setup

These steps only need to be done once per machine.

#### 1. Install X11 Server

**For macOS users:**
- Install XQuartz: `brew install --cask xquartz`
- Start XQuartz and enable "Allow connections from network clients" in Preferences > Security

**For Linux users:**
- X11 should be available by default

#### 2. Build the shared Qt base images

From the **root directory** of the repository:

```bash
docker build --target qt-dev-env -t qtapp-qt-dev-env:latest .
docker build --target qt-runtime-nano -t qtapp-qt-runtime-nano:latest .
```

> **Note:** The dev environment is ~1.33 GB (used only for building) and the runtime is ~242 MB. All lessons share these base images, so each individual lesson only adds ~16 KB (just the executable). This keeps total storage minimal even with 28 lessons!

#### 3. Grant X11 access to Docker containers

From the **root directory** of the repository:

```bash
./scripts/xhost-allow-for-compose.sh allow
```

> **Note:** This disables X11 access control to allow Docker containers to display GUI applications. Run this once per session (after reboot, you'll need to run it again). To revoke access later, run `./scripts/xhost-allow-for-compose.sh revoke`.

### Build and Run This Lesson

#### Step 1: Build this lesson's image

From the **lesson directory** (`21-animation-and-transitions`):

```bash
docker build -t qtapp-lesson21:latest .
```

#### Step 2: Run the application

**On macOS:**

```bash
docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -e QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=false;qt.qpa.*=false" qtapp-lesson21:latest
```

**On Linux:**

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -e QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=false;qt.qpa.*=false" \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    qtapp-lesson21:latest
```

### Alternative: Build locally (requires Qt 6 installed)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./lesson21
```

## What You'll See

An animation demo application featuring:
- Animated widget (green button) that moves and transforms
- Position animation with smooth movement across the window
- Size animation showing grow/shrink effects
- Fade animation with opacity changes
- Parallel animation running multiple properties simultaneously
- Sequential animation with step-by-step choreography
- Easing curve selector to experiment with different motion styles
- Reset button to restore the initial state

Try different easing curves to see how they dramatically affect the motion!

> **Note:** You may see harmless GL warnings in the console (like "failed to load driver: swrast"). These can be safely ignored - the application runs perfectly without hardware acceleration.

## Requirements

- **Qt Modules:** Qt6::Widgets, Qt6::Core
- **CMake:** 3.16 or higher
- **C++ Standard:** C++17
- **Docker:** For containerized build (recommended)
- **X11:** For GUI display on Linux/macOS

## Learning Objectives

- Creating property animations with QPropertyAnimation
- Using easing curves for natural, fluid motion
- Parallel animations with QParallelAnimationGroup
- Sequential animations with QSequentialAnimationGroup
- Handling animation completion signals and state changes
- Setting key values for complex multi-step animations
- Managing animation memory with DeleteWhenStopped policy
- Combining animations for sophisticated effects

## Notes

- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build: lessons use the `qt-runtime-nano` base (~242 MB) which contains only essential Qt libraries needed to run applications
- The dev environment (`qt-dev-env`) is only needed for building and is ~1.33 GB
- Qt's animation framework uses the property system, so any Q_PROPERTY can be animated
- Easing curves control the acceleration/deceleration of animations for more natural movement
- For headless testing or CI environments, you can use `Xvfb` (virtual framebuffer) instead of a real X11 server
- On Windows with Docker Desktop, use an X server like VcXsrv and set `DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0`
- Harmless GL/Mesa warnings about missing drivers can be ignored - the app works fine without hardware acceleration
