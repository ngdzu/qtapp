Decision: Draft `doc/SRS.md` and `doc/VVPlan.md` with feature lists, acceptance criteria, and test mappings for safety-critical behaviors.

Context: Regulatory-oriented docs should list functional and non-functional requirements and map to verification tests.

Constraints:
- Keep documents high-level; include references to test artifacts and acceptance criteria for alarms, data retention, and security.

Expected output:
- `doc/SRS.md` and `doc/VVPlan.md` with traceability matrix template.

Run/Verify:
- Manual review and alignment with project roadmap; link tests to SRS items.
