## Status: ⏳ Planned

**Reference:** `../../z-monitor/architecture_and_design/20_ERROR_HANDLING_STRATEGY.md`, `../../z-monitor/architecture_and_design/44_ERROR_RECOVERY_PATTERNS.md`

This document will provide foundational knowledge about the bulkhead pattern, which isolates failures to prevent cascading failures across different parts of the system.
