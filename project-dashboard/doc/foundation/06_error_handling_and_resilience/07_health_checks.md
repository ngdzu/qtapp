## Status: ⏳ Planned

**Reference:** `../../z-monitor/architecture_and_design/20_ERROR_HANDLING_STRATEGY.md`, `../../z-monitor/architecture_and_design/44_ERROR_RECOVERY_PATTERNS.md`

This document will provide foundational knowledge about health checks, which monitor service health to inform circuit breaker decisions and system status.

- **Circuit Breaker** (`03_circuit_breaker.md`) - Use health check results to inform circuit breaker state
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff** (`04_retry_backoff.md`) - Retry failed operations
- **Graceful Degradation** (`05_graceful_degradation.md`) - Continue operating with reduced functionality
