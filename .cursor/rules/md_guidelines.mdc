# Markdown Guidelines

- Keep Markdown syntax valid: verify headers, lists, code fences, and tables render correctly.
- For tables, ensure each row has the same number of `|` separators and include an alignment row (`| --- |` etc.).
- Avoid trailing whitespace inside table cells; leave a blank line before and after tables and large code blocks for readability.
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ```cpp) and ensure code samples compile or at least type-check.
- When adding complex sections (callouts, nested lists), preview the file (e.g., via VS Code Markdown preview) to confirm formatting.
- **Do not include comments in shell/bash code blocks** - comments make it difficult to copy and paste commands. Instead, write explanatory text outside the code block before or after it.
- **Always use markdown links for file references** - When referencing other markdown files, use proper markdown link syntax `[link text](relative/path/to/file.md)` instead of just listing the path as plain text. This makes documents navigable and improves the reading experience. Example: Use `[Sensor Integration Summary](../z-monitor/architecture_and_design/37_SENSOR_INTEGRATION.md)` instead of `doc/z-monitor/architecture_and_design/37_SENSOR_INTEGRATION.md`.
