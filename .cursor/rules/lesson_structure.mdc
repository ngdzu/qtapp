# Lesson Structure Requirements

Each lesson folder must include the following:

1. **lesson.md** (300-600 words) – learning goals, 2-3 code snippets, example walkthrough, Expected Output, Try It exercise, and key takeaways.
2. **quiz.md** (5-10 questions) – include 2-3 conceptual, 2-4 practical code, and 1-2 reflection questions, numbered, with Qt/C++ snippets as needed.
3. **answers.md** – repeat each question, give a direct one-sentence answer plus 1-3 sentences referencing the lesson, and include corrected/complete code. Highlight pitfalls and prevention.
4. **main.cpp** (and headers) – single executable with one `main()`, concise demo of the lesson concept, idiomatic Qt/C++.
5. **CMakeLists.txt** – minimal cross-platform setup, `find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS ... REQUIRED)`, `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17`, `CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON`, install target to `/opt/lesson##/`.
6. **Dockerfile** – multi-stage build using `qtapp-qt-dev-env:latest` and `qtapp-qt-runtime:latest`, builder copies/builds/installs, runtime copies only the executable with minimal layers.
7. **README.md** – prerequisites (X11 for GUI), consistent build/run instructions, expected behavior description, and **no comments inside code blocks**.
