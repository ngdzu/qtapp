# Code Style Guidelines

## C++ & Qt
- Target C++17, modern idioms, and Qt 6 APIs.
- Favor new-style signals/slots: `QObject::connect(&obj, &Class::signal, lambda)`.
- Leverage parent-child ownership instead of manual deletes.
- Keep examples focused—avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Documentation
- Write clear, concise explanations for C++ devs new to Qt.
- Explain the “why”, not just “how”.
- Reference official Qt docs when useful.
- Highlight common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
