# Code Style Guidelines

## Documentation
- Write clear, concise explanations for C++ devs new to Qt.
- Explain the "why", not just "how".
- Reference official Qt docs when useful.
- Highlight common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

## API Documentation (CRITICAL)
- **ALL public classes, methods, properties, and enums MUST have Doxygen-style comments (`/** */`)**
- See `.cursor/rules/api_documentation.mdc` for complete API documentation requirements
- Documentation is required from the beginning - not optional
- Code reviews will reject code without proper API documentation
