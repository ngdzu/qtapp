# QML Editing Guidelines

- After editing any QML file, run the associated screenshot/build script to validate the UI.
- For the sensor simulator, run `project-dashboard/scripts/capture_screenshot.sh` (from within `project-dashboard/`). It rebuilds the container, launches the app headlessly, and refreshes `project-dashboard/sensor-simulator/resources/screenshot.png`.
