# Lesson 1: Qt Setup

This lesson demonstrates a minimal Qt Widgets application: a simple window displaying "Hello, Qt!".

## Building and Running

### One-Time Setup

These steps only need to be done once per machine.

#### 1. Install X11 Server

**For macOS users:**
- Install XQuartz: `brew install --cask xquartz`
- Start XQuartz and enable "Allow connections from network clients" in Preferences > Security

**For Linux users:**
- X11 should be available by default

#### 2. Build the shared Qt base images

From the **root directory** of the repository:

```bash
docker build --target qt-dev-env -t qtapp-qt-dev-env:latest .
docker build --target qt-runtime-nano -t qtapp-qt-runtime-nano:latest .
```

> **Note:** The dev environment is ~1.33 GB (used only for building) and the runtime is ~242 MB. All lessons share these base images, so each individual lesson only adds ~16 KB (just the executable). This keeps total storage minimal even with 28 lessons!

#### 3. Grant X11 access to Docker containers

From the **root directory** of the repository:

```bash
./scripts/xhost-allow-for-compose.sh allow
```

> **Note:** This disables X11 access control to allow Docker containers to display GUI applications. Run this once per session (after reboot, you'll need to run it again). To revoke access later, run `./scripts/xhost-allow-for-compose.sh revoke`.

### Build and Run This Lesson

#### Step 1: Build this lesson's image

From the **lesson directory** (`01-qt-setup`):

```bash
docker build -t qtapp-lesson01:latest .
```

#### Step 2: Run the application

**On macOS:**

```bash
docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -e QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=false;qt.qpa.*=false" qtapp-lesson01:latest
```

**On Linux:**

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -e QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=false;qt.qpa.*=false" \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    qtapp-lesson01:latest
```

### Alternative: Build locally (requires Qt 6 installed)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./qt-setup
```

## What You'll See

A small window (300×100 pixels) with the centered text "Hello, Qt!" and the window title "Lesson 1: Qt Setup". Click the close button to exit.

> **Note:** You may see harmless GL warnings in the console (like "failed to load driver: swrast"). These can be safely ignored - the application runs perfectly without hardware acceleration.

## Requirements

- **Qt Modules:** Qt6::Widgets
- **CMake:** 3.16 or higher
- **C++ Standard:** C++17
- **Docker:** For containerized build (recommended)
- **X11:** For GUI display on Linux/macOS

## Notes

- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build: lessons use the `qt-runtime-nano` base (~242 MB) which contains only essential Qt libraries needed to run applications
- The dev environment (`qt-dev-env`) is only needed for building and is ~1.33 GB
- For headless testing or CI environments, you can use `Xvfb` (virtual framebuffer) instead of a real X11 server
- On Windows with Docker Desktop, use an X server like VcXsrv and set `DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0`
- Harmless GL/Mesa warnings about missing drivers can be ignored - the app works fine without hardware acceleration

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not connect to display"**: Ensure X11 server is running and use the `xhost-allow-for-compose.sh` script to grant X11 access.

**"Qt6 not found"**: Verify the base images are built correctly using the commands in Step 1.

**"qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin"**: This usually means Qt GUI libraries are missing. Rebuild the base images to ensure all Qt dependencies are installed.
